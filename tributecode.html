			About the Legend
		</h1>
		<p>
			• Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, popularly known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow,
			Madhya Pradesh, India.<br><br>
			• Ambedkar was a key architect of the Indian Constitution and served as the first Law and Justice Minister
			of independent India.<br><br>
			• He earned multiple doctorates from prestigious institutions like Columbia University and the London School
			of Economics, specializing in economics, law, and political science.<br><br>
			• As a leader of the Dalits (formerly known as untouchables), Ambedkar dedicated his life to fighting social
			discrimination and advocating for the rights of marginalized communities in India.<br><br>
			• Ambedkar was instrumental in the formation of the Indian Constitution, ensuring it enshrined fundamental
			rights and aimed to eliminate caste discrimination.<br><br>
			• In 1932, he played a significant role in negotiating the Poona Pact with Mahatma Gandhi, which provided
			reserved seats for Dalits in the provincial legislatures within the framework of a single Hindu electorate.
			• Ambedkar's scholarly works include 'Annihilation of Caste,' a groundbreaking critique of the caste system,
			and 'The Buddha and His Dhamma,' which outlines his conversion to Buddhism and its teachings.<br><br>
			• In 1956, Ambedkar embraced Buddhism along with millions of his followers, initiating the Dalit Buddhist
			Movement to escape the caste-based oppression in Hinduism.<br><br>
			• He served on various commissions and committees, notably contributing to labor reforms, economic planning,
			and social justice policies in India.<br><br>
			• Ambedkar was honored posthumously with the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in 1990 for his
			contributions to the nation.<br><br>
			• His birthday, April 14, is celebrated as Ambedkar Jayanti and is a public holiday in India, marking his
			legacy and influence on Indian society.<br><br>
			• Ambedkar's contributions to women's rights, including advocating for gender equality and women’s
			education, are also widely recognized.<br><br>
			• Throughout his life, Ambedkar faced immense social and political challenges but remained steadfast in his
			mission to promote equality, justice, and human rights.<br><br>
			• Ambedkar passed away on December 6, 1956, in New Delhi, but his vision and efforts continue to inspire
			movements for social justice and equality in India and around the world.<br><br>
